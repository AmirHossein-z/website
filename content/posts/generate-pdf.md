Generating a one-page report PDF in a web project is simple, and each programming languages or framework have its own solutions or libraries for developers. But it’s getting hard when you want to generate a PDF that has special requirements like having multi-page contents, language-specific, or the contents of the PDF are placed dynamically(like it’s HTML elements), and you have no idea how the content will be shown correctly for all cases. In this post, I want to explain my journey for generating good-enough PDFs.
